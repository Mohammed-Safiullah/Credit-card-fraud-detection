# Credit-card-fraud-detection
A credit card fraud detection system using machine learning.

**Description**
This project is focused on developing a machine learning model for detecting financial fraud in real-time during transactions. It involves exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model selection, and training predictive models using various machine learning algorithms such as Neural Networks.

**Requirements**
Python
Pandas
NumPy
Machine Learning
Deep learning
Neural Networks
**Installation**
Clone this repository.
Install the required packages using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Run main.py to train the model and generate predictions.
**Usage**
Provide input data in CSV format to main.py.
The script will perform data pre-processing, feature engineering, and training of the machine learning model.
The model will then be used to predict fraud during transactions.
